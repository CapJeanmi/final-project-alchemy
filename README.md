# Final Project to Alchemy University

This is my final project to Ethereum Developer Bootcamp. This project executes with a simple user interface, an ICO to raise funds for a project.

The contract has been deployed into Sepolia Testnet Network with address:

```shell
0xA4D055096C7a804EF99EF7cDA2aBb7595442C463
```

# Running the Project in Local Enviroment

First, clone this repository.

```shell
npm i - (Parent Folder).
cd app
npm i - (App Folder).
npm run dev
```

To buy, you need Sepolia Testnet ETH in a Wallet. To withdraw contract funds, you need to contact me to gives you the private_key of the Owner Wallet. Or just deploy the contract again and replace the contract address in /constants/index.js.

To check tests, in parent folder run:
```shell
npx hardhat test
```
